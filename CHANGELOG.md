## Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Buffer-and-veto approach**: Chosen for balance between safety and responsiveness
- **Multi-layer filtering**: Combines fast pattern matching with AI-based assessment
- **Fail-safe design**: Defaults to blocking when uncertain or on errors
- **Docker-first**: Prioritizes containerized deployment for consistency and scalability

### Technical Implementation
- **FastAPI**: For high-performance async API with automatic documentation
- **LangChain**: For LLM integration and streaming capabilities
- **Pydantic**: For configuration validation and data models
- **Nginx**: For reverse proxy, load balancing, and security headers
- **Docker Compose**: For multi-service orchestration

### Performance Characteristics
- **Latency**: ~150-400ms additional delay for safety buffering
- **Throughput**: Handles concurrent requests with horizontal scaling
- **Memory**: Efficient token buffering with configurable limits
- **CPU**: Optimized regex patterns with minimal overhead

### Security Model
- **Risk Scoring**: Cumulative scoring system with configurable thresholds
- **Pattern Detection**: Comprehensive regex patterns for common PII/sensitive content
- **LLM Judge**: Secondary assessment for complex/nuanced cases
- **Safe Responses**: Context-aware template responses for blocked content
