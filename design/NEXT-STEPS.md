## CORE PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

**Current Issue**: The system analyzes ONE TOKEN AT A TIME, which is:
- ❌ Extremely expensive (1000 tokens = 1000 API calls)
- ❌ Lacks context for accurate compliance decisions  
- ❌ Poor visibility into what's being analyzed and why

**Required Solution**: Implement SLIDING WINDOW ANALYSIS
- ✅ Analyze windows of 100-200 tokens at a time
- ✅ Cost-efficient (1000 tokens = ~10-20 analysis calls)
- ✅ Better context for compliance decisions
- ✅ Clear visualization of analysis process

## CLIENT REQUIREMENTS (MUST DELIVER)

### REQUIREMENT 1: Real-time Buffering & Validation
- **Current**: Token-by-token analysis ❌
- **Needed**: Sliding window analysis with clear buffering visualization ✅

### REQUIREMENT 2: Transparent Decision Making  
- **Current**: Hidden decision process ❌
- **Needed**: Live visualization showing:
  1. **What set of tokens** is being analyzed (exact window boundaries)
  2. **How the decision** was made (scoring breakdown, pattern matches)
  3. **Pass/Block result** with clear reasoning

### REQUIREMENT 3: Engineer Demo Ready
Must answer these anticipated questions:
- "Why not analyze every word?" → Show cost/efficiency benefits
- "How do you avoid false positives?" → Show confidence scoring
- "What's the performance impact?" → Show analysis frequency controls
- "How does this scale?" → Show configurable parameters

## 48-HOUR EXECUTION PLAN

### DAY 1 (24 hours) - CORE FUNCTIONALITY

#### Phase 1A: Backend Analysis Engine (8 hours) ⏰
**File**: `app.py` - Lines 1000-1400 (streaming logic)

**Tasks**:
1. **Implement Sliding Window Analysis**
   - Add `ANALYSIS_WINDOW_SIZE = 150` tokens
   - Add `ANALYSIS_OVERLAP = 50` tokens  
   - Add `ANALYSIS_FREQUENCY` control (analyze every N tokens)
   
2. **Separate Buffering from Analysis**
   - Keep `delay_tokens` for streaming buffer (UI responsiveness)
   - Add `analysis_window_size` for compliance analysis (accuracy)
   - Implement efficient token counting with tiktoken

3. **Enhanced Decision Tracking**
   - Track which exact window triggered decisions
   - Store analysis context with results
   - Add detailed scoring breakdown

#### Phase 1B: Frontend Visualization (8 hours) ⏰  
**Files**: 
- `frontend/src/components/pages/StreamMonitor.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/ui/` (new components)

**Tasks**:
1. **Analysis Window Display**
   - Show current analysis window boundaries
   - Highlight analyzed text segments
   - Display window overlap visualization

2. **Decision Breakdown Panel**
   - Real-time scoring by category (PII/PHI/PCI)
   - Pattern match details with confidence scores
   - Decision reasoning timeline

3. **Interactive Controls**
   - Analysis window size slider (50-300 tokens)
   - Analysis frequency control (every N tokens)
   - Risk threshold adjustment

#### Phase 1C: Integration & Testing (8 hours) ⏰
**Tasks**:
1. **Connect Backend to Frontend**
   - Update SSE events with window analysis data
   - Add new event types for analysis details
   - Test sliding window with various inputs

2. **Performance Optimization** 
   - Benchmark analysis cost reduction
   - Optimize token processing pipeline
   - Add performance metrics to UI

### DAY 2 (24 hours) - DEMO POLISH & FEATURES

#### Phase 2A: Demo Scenarios (6 hours) ⏰
**Tasks**:
1. **Pre-built Demo Cases**
   - HIPAA violation example (PHI data)
   - PCI DSS violation example (credit card)
   - GDPR violation example (PII data)
   - Safe content example (no violations)

2. **Engineer-Friendly Metrics**
   - Analysis cost comparison (old vs new)
   - Accuracy metrics with different window sizes
   - Performance impact measurements

#### Phase 2B: Advanced Visualization (8 hours) ⏰
**Tasks**:
1. **Analysis Heat Map**
   - Visual representation of text analysis
   - Color-coded risk levels by token
   - Window boundary indicators

2. **Real-time Decision Flow**
   - Animated decision tree visualization
   - Pattern matching pipeline view
   - Confidence score evolution

#### Phase 2C: Production Polish (6 hours) ⏰
**Tasks**:
1. **Configuration Management**
   - Environment-based settings
   - Save/load analysis configurations
   - Export analysis reports

2. **Error Handling & Edge Cases**
   - Network disconnection handling
   - Large text analysis optimization
   - Graceful degradation

#### Phase 2D: Documentation & Demo Prep (4 hours) ⏰
**Tasks**:
1. **Demo Script Preparation**
   - Key talking points for engineers
   - Performance comparison data
   - Live demo scenarios

2. **Technical Documentation**
   - Architecture explanation
   - Configuration options
   - Deployment instructions
